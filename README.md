A collection of design patterns and idioms in Python.

## Current Patterns

__Creational Patterns__:

| Pattern | Description |
|:-------:| ----------- |
| [Abstract Factory](patterns/creational/abstract_factory.py) | use a generic function with specific factories |
| [Builder](patterns/creational/builder.py) | instead of using multiple constructors, builder  receives parameters and returns constructed objects |
| [Factory Method](patterns/creational/factory.py) | delegate a specialized function/method to create instances|
| [Prototype](patterns/creational/prototype.py) | use a factory and clones of a prototype for new instances (if instantiation is expensive) |
| [Singleton](patterns/creational/singleton.py) | Ensures that the class has only one instance, and provides a global access point to it. |

__Structural Patterns__:

| Pattern | Description |
|:-------:| ----------- |
| [Adapter](patterns/structural/adapter.py) | converts the interface of one class to the interface of another that clients expect. |
| [Bridge](patterns/structural/bridge.py) | a client-provider middleman to soften interface changes |
| [Composite](patterns/structural/composite.py) | lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly |
| [Decorator](patterns/structural/decorator.py) | wrap functionality with other functionality in order to affect outputs |
| [Facade](patterns/structural/facade.py) | use one class as an API to a number of others |
| [Flyweight](patterns/structural/flyweight.py) | transparently reuse existing instances of objects with similar/identical state |
| [Proxy](patterns/structural/proxy.py) | an object funnels operations to something else |

__Behavior Patterns__:

|                                  Pattern                                  | Description |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:| ----------- |
|              [Blackboard](patterns/behavioral/blackboard.py)              | architectural model, assemble different sub-system knowledge to build a solution, AI approach - non gang of four pattern. |
| [Chain Of Responsibility](patterns/behavioral/chain_of_responsibility.py) | apply a chain of successive handlers to try and process the data. |
|                 [Command](patterns/behavioral/command.py)                 | bundle a command and arguments to call later. |
|             [Interpreter](patterns/behavioral/interpreter.py)             | a behavioral design pattern that solves a frequently encountered but subject to change problem. |
|                [Iterator](patterns/behavioral/iterator.py)                | traverse a container and access the container's elements. |
|                [Mediator](patterns/behavioral/mediator.py)                | an object that knows how to connect other objects and act as a proxy. |
|                 [Memento](patterns/behavioral/memento.py)                 | generate an opaque token that can be used to go back to a previous state. |
|                [Observer](patterns/behavioral/observer.py)                | provide a callback for notification of events/changes to data. |
|                   [State](patterns/behavioral/state.py)                   | logic is organized into a discrete number of potential states and the next state that can be transitioned to. |
|                [Strategy](patterns/behavioral/strategy.py)                | selectable operations over the same data. |
|         [Template Method](patterns/behavioral/template_method.py)         |defines the basis of the algorithm and allows subclasses to override some of the steps in the algorithm, without changing its structure as a whole. |
|                 [Visitor](patterns/behavioral/visitor.py)                 | invoke a callback for all items of a collection. |
